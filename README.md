Team: interesting-tern


The goal of this project is to create Postalicious, a loose clone of the Postman extension for Google Chrome. It is an app that lets you send custom HTTP requests to a server via a web form and displays both the request and the response messages.

It is an API with a GUI front end web form.

It has a dependency called sandbox server (a simple HTTP server), which you will create using Node JS and Express.
